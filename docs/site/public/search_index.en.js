has two top module: Build Engine &amp; Apply Engine\nThe Build Engine Using Kubefile and build context as Input, and build a CloudImage that contains all the dependencies.\nThe Apply Engine Using Clusterfile to Init a cluster witch contains kubernetes and other applications.\nBuild Engine\n\nParser : parse Kubefile into image metadata\nRegistry : push or pull the CloudImage\nStore : save CloudImage to local disks\n\nBuilders\n\nLite Builder, sealer will check all the manifest or helm chart, decode docker images in those files, and cache then into CloudImage\nCloud Builder, sealer will create a Cluster using public cloud, and exec RUN &amp; CMD command witch defined in Kubefile, then cache all the docker image in the Cluster.\nContainer Builder, Using Docker container as a node, run kubernetes cluster in container then cache all the docker images\n\nApply Engine\n\nInfra : manage infrastructure, like create VMs in public cloud then apply the cluster on top of it. Or using docker emulation nodes.\nRuntime : cluster installer implementation, like using kubeadm to installl cluster.\nConfig : application config, like mysql username passwd or other configs, you can using Config overwrite any file you want.\nPlugin : plugin help us do some extra work, like exec a shell command before install, or add a label to a node after install.\nDebug : help us check the cluster is helth or not, found reason when things unexpected.\n\nOther modules\n\nFilesystem : Copy CloudRootfs files to all nodes\nMount : mount CloudImage all layers together\nChecker : do some precheck and post check\nCommand : a command proxy to do some task witch os don't have the command.
